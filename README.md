# 📊 Angular Dashboard

Welcome to the **Angular Dashboard** project! This is a simple and scalable dashboard application built using Angular, Bootstrap, and SCSS. The dashboard displays charts, tables, and card information using dummy data. Perfect for getting started with Angular and creating responsive dashboards!

## 🚀 Features

- **Charts**: Interactive charts powered by `Chart.js` and `ng2-charts`.
- **Tables**: Simple tables displaying dynamic data.
- **Cards**: Information cards to display key metrics.
- **Scalable Structure**: Organized folder structure for easy scalability and maintainability.
